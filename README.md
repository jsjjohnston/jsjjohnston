### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jay Johnston, a neurodivergent software developer based in Melbourne, Australia. I have a passion for coding in various languages, homebrewing, and gardening. Hereâ€™s a bit more about me:

- ðŸ”­ Currently working on a project using open-source LLMs to help software development project managers write better user stories.
- ðŸŒ± Diving deep into NixOS and honing my skills in React.
- ðŸ‘¯ Eager to collaborate on projects that help neurodivergent individuals find the right fit and align with my goal to work in altruistic environments.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about homebrewing, especially beer, wine, and mead.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [Connect on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jay-johnston-79956223/)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him/his
- âš¡ Fun fact: I believe that learning as much as possible across different domains is essential. A broad range of knowledge enhances problem-solving abilities, enabling openness to new ideas and creative solutions beyond rules-based thinking.

When I'm not coding or brewing, you might find me exploring new recipes, working in the garden, or playing video games like Final Fantasy, Metal Gear Solid, and Tomb Raider. Feel free to connect with me if you'd like to collaborate or chat about any of my interests!
